## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Fluid Typography](https://royalfig.github.io/fluid-typography-calculator/)
- [Angular](https://angular.dev/overview)

### What I learned

This project was a great way to support my Angular learning. Its simplicity made it easy to design and develop, giving me the chance to practice core Angular concepts like inputs, outputs, and conditional rendering.

### Future Improvements

For future update, some type of form validation will definitively be useful, as this will provide feedback to the user about the state of the rating form, such as missing inputs or possible errors.
